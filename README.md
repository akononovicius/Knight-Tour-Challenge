Knight-Tour-Challenge
=====================

HTML and jQuery implementation of the famous graph theory problem - [Knight's Tour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour).

#How to play

In this "game" you have to produce the longest possible sequence of moves of a chess knight, while visiting squares on the board only once. This sequence is called "tour". If your tour visits every square, then you have acchieved a full tour. If you have acchieved a full tour and from your last position you could move to your initial square, then you have acchieved a full closed tour.

The program shows all possible moves from your currently occupied square.
